# Narpion App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Narbion-AI-Matchmaking-Model
[Narbion Model](https://github.com/marws171/Narbion-AI-Matchmaking-Model)
AI model for Narbion, a matchmaking system that connects athletes with suitable opponents based on skill level, availability, location, and sport Built with a neural network trained on a realistic dataset of 10,000 players Achieved 93.86% accuracy.
# Narbion Matchmaking AI Model

This repository contains the core AI model used in the Narbion app, a smart matchmaking platform that connects athletes with suitable opponents based on multiple features such as sport type, skill level, location, and availability.

# 📁 File Structure
- `narbion_model.ipynb` – Core notebook containing data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `players_data_full_realistic.csv` – Main dataset used for training.

---

# 🧪 Testing and Validation
The model was tested using an 80/20 train-test split and validated through classification metrics and matchmaking accuracy. A UI/UX prototype and Flutter mobile app were also developed as part of the full solution.
